# WinTagger
WinTagger is a C# WinForms programs that allows users to correct hotel information, and to tag keywords onto the property.


## Background ##
The hotel and travel industry is characterized by very fragmented information space, whereby each provider such as CTrip, Sabre, Expedia, etc, all follow some standards, and yet have proprietary details in their APIs. Also, location and addresses may be spelt slightly differently, and field names may also slightly differ. Therefore, the purpose of this system is to help the operator to correct, standardize, and tag their own database by comparing it to upstream Provider's data sources.


## WinTagger - Main Window ##
Allows user to retrieve own's data on the left, and compare it to Provider's data on the right panel, and then corrects and save to database.
